Hello! Welcome to my first project! This website is designed to offer my skills as a web developer, musical performer, and model as a service. 
My aim is to make it stand out amongst other artist's websites not only from a visual design perspective, but a user friendly design
perspective as well. Enjoy! 

I included code from Spotify's web generator to create the play button on my projects page.
I also included code from bootstrap for the general layout of the website including the navbar, modal, and footer. 

On my contact page I attempted to create a modal that only popped up when the required fields were filled in but this was beyond my current skill level. 
I did a couple hours of research, asked questions, but still remained confused as to how to do it so I left the modal as it was. 

You'll notice that some of the mobile pages don't have a link to my portfolio. The reason for this is that I ran in to an issue with the footer
covering up my content.
